Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client was Artemis Financial, they gave financial plans to their clients and worked with many government and corporations. Because of this they needed to have proper security for themselves and for their clients. The security of their application was needed to be evaluated for any vulnerabilities and threats of attack. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I believe I did well at assessing out the vulnerabilities could be fixed and or dealt with if there was no fix at the time. It is important to code securely because if not your code could be exploited or rendered obselete by outside threats. So making sure your code is effective and itself protected is a must. The value of software security affects the wellbeing of a company greatly. If the software is not secure, the company could lose clients, money, important data, and more importantly their reputation for future business.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Knowing the differences in vulnerability, between more critical vulnerabilities and minor ones was helpful. Learning which vulnerabilities could be the biggest threat and how to deal with them is useful not just for my schooling but for my future career in technology and software security.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased my layers of security using more complex methods of encryption and keys to keep data protected. Having 256-bit keys and AES lays of security makes it very difficult for attackers to access the data. I would use checksum and dependency checks with java code methods that we have learned throughout the course. I find them the best methods and provides much detail into the vulnerabilities and options to mitigate them. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

In order to make sure the application was function and secure while also checking for new vulnerabilities, I first complied the refactored code for any errors. If no errors were present I would use dependency checks for any known or new vulnerabilities, making sure to get rid of false positives if needed. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Using dependency checks with the maven plugin is one I would use definetly, also having the coding practice of checking for false positives and assessing vulnerabilities that do not have active fixes was very useful information. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show them my knowledge of the best encryption and security practices, knowing what works and what does not is the difference between proper protection and not. Also being able to make smart decisions of security when problems do exist is just as important, knowledge of vulnerabilities will provide me with the skills to have a successful computer technology career.
